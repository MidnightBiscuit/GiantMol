## Programs

[TOC]



### SimAnalysisPointbyPoint

This program treats data from interaction simulations of GMol with Ca+. The simulation produces one directory for each condition (i.e point with unique paramters). This structured is used since 2020 01 31.



### PlotOscilloLabview

This program allows for plotting data taken from oscilloscopes or labview. I set parameters for different oscillo brands and versions (Siglent 1102CML+, Lecroy Waveace 2022, Lecroy Wavesurfer 3034). I talk about GiantMol Labview. This is useful for any oscillo-based purpose, in particular I need this for MCP reading.



### H2MAnalysis

This program treats data from H2M mass spectrometry. I can test molecules on their setup and then process the MCP measurment with this program.



### MCPAnalysis

This program treats data from MCP. Often recorded with oscilloscopes.



### ImageAnalysis

This program treats images from camera. Can also be useful for any other image analysis, such as beam profile.
